# Musical Instrument Classification using Deep Learning Techniques
## Overview
The project focuses on the classification of audio files of musical instruments using Deep Learning techniques.

The main objective is to develop a system capable of accurately recognizing and classifying musical instruments through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), by analyzing MFCC coefficients and Mel-Spectrograms.
